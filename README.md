> Petra Kat's Pretty Cool Publishing Boilerplate Plugin

This is just a plugin to do some boilerplate for my mods:
- Publishing to Curseforge and Maven
- Pre-process json5 files into json
- Set up artifact coordinates
- Etc
 
This plugin is in continual "prerelease" status; this is because I'm the only one who'll be using this plugin, so it's easier
for me to just update the number as it happens.
